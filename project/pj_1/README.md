# ECE4721J: Project 1

Big data analysis on [Million Song Dataset (MSD)](http://millionsongdataset.com). You can check the slide in `report/` folder for quick overview.

Goals:
- Work with Hadoop, Drill and Spark
- Compare MapReduce and Spark
- Perform advanced data analysis on big data
- Develop presentations skills (slides + poster)

Team members:
- Yiding Chang
- Yifan Shen
- Kexuan Huang

## Milestone 0: HDF5 Data Pre-process

1. Compact small `hdf5` files into larger one
2. Read `hdf5` file and extract the information
3. Convert `hdf5` to `Avro` with `Apache Avroâ„¢`

## Milestone 1: Drill Database Query

1. Find the range of dates covered by the songs in the dataset, i.e. the age of the oldest and of the youngest songs
2. Find the hottest song that is the shortest and shows highest energy with lowest tempo
3. Find the name of the album with the most tracks
4. Find the name of the band who recorded the longest song

## Milestone 2: Advanced Data Analysis

1. Determine distance between artists with adjacency matrix, using parallelized BFS
2. Propose similar songs with distance and "provide more diverse recommendations"
3. Implement the above algorithm in both Mapreduce and Spark
4. Compare the performance of Mapreduce and Spark
