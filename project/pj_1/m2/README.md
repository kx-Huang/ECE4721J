## Milestone 2: Advanced Data Analysis

1. Determine distance between artists with adjacency matrix, using parallelized BFS
2. Propose similar songs with distance and "provide more diverse recommendations"
3. Do it in both MapReduce and Spark to compare the time
4. Prepare a set of slides with Beamer and a poster with Beamerposter for presentations
