## Milestone 2: Advanced Data Analysis

1. Determine distance between artists with adjacency matrix, using parallelized BFS
2. Propose similar songs with distance and "provide more diverse recommendations"
3. Implement the above algorithm in both Mapreduce and Spark
4. Compare the performance of Mapreduce and Spark
